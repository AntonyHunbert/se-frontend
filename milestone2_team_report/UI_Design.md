## 6. UI Design

We designed a simple and beautiful UI theme for the website, and displayed it on some pages that have been built. For example, on the homepage of the website, we have designed clear functional partitions for the convenience of users:

<img src='./主页.png'/>

For the front-end pages that have not been completed yet, we have also designed the page layout and functional partitions to ensure the consistency of the overall theme. The following is the page design of the two main functions:

- Personal page:

  <img src='./个人主页.png'/>

- Order details page：

  <img src='./order详情页.png'/>
